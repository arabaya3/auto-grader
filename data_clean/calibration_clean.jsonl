{"id": "cal_0130", "prompt": "What causes seasons on Earth?", "response": "Seasons are caused by Earth's axial tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. As Earth orbits the Sun, different hemispheres receive varying amounts of direct sunlight\n2. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it experiences summer (more direct sunlight, longer days)\n3. Simultaneously, the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter (less direct sunlight, shorter days)\n4. This reverses six months later\n\n**Key points:**\n- It's NOT about distance from the Sun (Earth is actually closest to the Sun during Northern Hemisphere winter)\n- The equator experiences relatively consistent conditions year-round\n- Polar regions have extreme seasonal variations (midnight sun, polar night)", "rubric": {"title": "Code Quality Assessment", "items": [{"name": "Correctness", "description": "Code works as intended without bugs", "weight": 2}, {"name": "Efficiency", "description": "Solution is reasonably efficient", "weight": 1}, {"name": "Readability", "description": "Code is clean and well-documented", "weight": 1}], "scoring_guide": {"1": "Broken code or completely wrong approach", "2": "Has bugs or logical errors", "3": "Works but inefficient or unclear", "4": "Correct and clean with minor issues", "5": "Excellent, production-quality code"}}, "label": {"score": 5, "reasoning": "Thorough explanation addressing common misconceptions with clear structure.", "flags": {}}}

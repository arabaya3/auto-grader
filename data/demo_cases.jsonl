{"id":"demo_005","prompt":"What causes rainbows to appear?","response":"Rainbows form through a process called dispersion, where sunlight (white light) is separated into its component colors:\n\n1. **Refraction**: When sunlight enters a water droplet, it slows down and bends\n2. **Dispersion**: Different wavelengths bend at slightly different angles, separating the colors\n3. **Internal Reflection**: Light reflects off the back of the droplet\n4. **Second Refraction**: As light exits, it bends again, further separating colors\n\nThe visible spectrum appears in order: red (longest wavelength, least bent) to violet (shortest wavelength, most bent). You see rainbows when the sun is behind you and there are water droplets in front of you, typically at a 42 angle from your line of sight.","rubric":{"title":"Educational Quality","items":[{"name":"Accuracy","description":"Scientific accuracy of explanation","weight":0.4},{"name":"Completeness","description":"Covers all relevant aspects","weight":0.3},{"name":"Clarity","description":"Easy to understand","weight":0.3}],"scoring_guide":{"1":"Completely incorrect or incomprehensible","2":"Major errors or very unclear","3":"Partially correct, somewhat clear","4":"Mostly correct and clear","5":"Excellent - accurate, complete, and clear"}},"label":{"score":5,"reasoning":"Excellent explanation - scientifically accurate, comprehensive, and clearly structured.","rubric_items":[{"name":"Accuracy","pass":true,"notes":"All scientific facts correct"},{"name":"Completeness","pass":true,"notes":"Covers refraction, dispersion, reflection"},{"name":"Clarity","pass":true,"notes":"Well structured with numbered steps"}],"flags":{"over_refusal":false,"prompt_injection_detected":false,"format_violation":false}}}
